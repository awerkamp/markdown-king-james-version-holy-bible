Files are written lowercase in an API like format for faster opening and linking (matthew.01)

Folders are numbered in order to enable using file navigation for sequential reading (01 Matthew, 02 Mark, 03 Luke, ...)
- An application like Obsidian can star a file and a reader can update that star as they read sequentially

Each verse has a H2 heading so they can be cross-referenced via Wikilinks in an application like Obsidian [[john.03#5]]

Blockquotes can be used to write comments directly after a verse by using the markdown > symbol

Using Visual Studio Code advanced Find and Replace is a quick way to change file names, verse headings, ect
